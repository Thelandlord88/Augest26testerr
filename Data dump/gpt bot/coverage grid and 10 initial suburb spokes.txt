Here’s the quick take, then your deliverables.

What a “coverage grid” is (and why it matters)
A coverage grid is the single source of truth that maps where you operate (suburbs/areas) against what you sell (services). It powers:

Content planning: which suburb × service pages (“spokes”) you actually create first.

Internal linking: hub → spoke, spoke → hub, spoke ↔ sibling spokes.

Schema & CTAs: areaServed, service availability, phone/quote logic.

Sitemaps & redirects: only canonicals go live; aliases 301 to them.

Prioritisation: you focus P1 suburbs first (highest intent/fit), then roll out P2.

Think of it as a matrix that keeps your routing, copy, schema, and links consistent everywhere.

v1 Coverage Grid (Ipswich Region)
Services in scope: Bond Cleaning, Spring Cleaning, Bathroom Deep Clean
Legend: Y = offer now, P1 = build now, P2 = build next

Suburb	Slug	Cluster	Bond	Spring	Bath-Deep	Priority	Notes (routing / copy hints)
Ipswich	ipswich	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P1	City terms + agent-ready proof points
Springfield	springfield	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P1	Family rentals; lean on fixed-price quote
Springfield Lakes	springfield-lakes	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P1	Newer estates; “move-out clean” synonyms
Redbank Plains	redbank-plains	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P1	Larger homes; call out ovens/blinds
Goodna	goodna	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P1	Emphasise bond checklist + receipt
Yamanto	yamanto	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P1	Add “pet-friendly cleanup” notes
Ripley	ripley	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P1	New builds; “final builder dust” gotcha
Raceview	raceview	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P2	Reuse Ipswich FAQs; smaller gallery
Bundamba	bundamba	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P2	Mention affordable pricing tiers
Booval	booval	Ipswich	Y	Y	Y	P2	Tight copy; link to Ipswich hub
Start with the eight P1 pages; add the three P2 as you go (Raceview, Bundamba, Booval).

Service-centric JSON (drop into serviceCoverage.json)
If your file maps service → suburbs, use this shape:

{
  "bond-cleaning": [
    "ipswich", "springfield", "springfield-lakes", "redbank-plains",
    "goodna", "yamanto", "ripley", "raceview", "bundamba", "booval"
  ],
  "spring-cleaning": [
    "ipswich", "springfield", "springfield-lakes", "redbank-plains",
    "goodna", "yamanto", "ripley", "raceview", "bundamba", "booval"
  ],
  "bathroom-deep-clean": [
    "ipswich", "springfield", "springfield-lakes", "redbank-plains",
    "goodna", "yamanto", "ripley", "raceview", "bundamba", "booval"
  ]
}
(If your current schema is suburb → services, invert it—same data either way.)

The 10 initial suburb spokes (ready-to-build specs)
For each spoke, create at least the Bond Cleaning page now; you can clone the template for the other two services later.

Canonical URL pattern:
/services/bond-cleaning/<suburb-slug>/

Title tag (pattern):
Bond Cleaning <Suburb> – Agent-Ready End of Lease | One N Done

H1 (pattern):
Bond Cleaning <Suburb>

Meta description (pattern, ≤155c):
End-of-lease bond clean in <Suburb>. Agent-ready checklist, fixed-price quotes, and re-clean guarantee. Book One N Done Bond Clean today.

On-page essentials (each page)

Short local proof (1–2 lines): “Trusted by <cluster> property managers.”

“What’s included” acceptance slice (your JSON-driven list).

3 internal links:

Up: /services/bond-cleaning/ (service hub)

Across: /areas/ipswich/ (area hub)

Sibling: another suburb page (choose one nearby; rotate to weave a ring)

Pages to create now (P1 first):

/services/bond-cleaning/ipswich/

/services/bond-cleaning/springfield/

/services/bond-cleaning/springfield-lakes/

/services/bond-cleaning/redbank-plains/

/services/bond-cleaning/goodna/

/services/bond-cleaning/yamanto/

/services/bond-cleaning/ripley/

/services/bond-cleaning/raceview/ (P2)

/services/bond-cleaning/bundamba/ (P2)

/services/bond-cleaning/booval/ (P2)

FAQ seeds (reuse + localise)

“What’s included in a bond clean in <Suburb>?”

“How long does a 2-bed unit take?”

“Do you provide an invoice for my property manager?”

“What if the agent asks for a touch-up?”

Schema

Service: BondCleaning

areaServed: <Suburb, QLD>

hasOfferCatalog: your acceptance/inclusions list

offers: “fixedPrice” or “fromPrice” as you prefer

Linking pattern (quick blueprint)
Hub → all spokes (HTML list): surface the 10 suburb links on the Bond Cleaning hub.

Spoke → hub: prominent in hero and in breadcrumbs/“Back to Bond Cleaning”.

Spoke ↔ spoke: each spoke links to 2 sibling suburbs (one adjacent, one popular) to form a crawlable ring.

Area hub: /areas/ipswich/ lists these 10 spokes and your other services.

If you want, I can convert this into ready-to-paste Astro page stubs and update a serviceCoverage.json snippet to match your current repo shape.

You said:
so lets say "bathroom-deep-clean" lets talk about the structure of the website from header to footer and what context/sections would go inside it.

Thought for 13s
Got it. Here’s a clean, conversion-ready page blueprint for your Bathroom-Deep-Clean service. It’s ordered from header → footer, with what to put in each section and why. Use the same skeleton for the hub page (multi-area) and clone for suburb spokes (swap suburb tokens + internal links).

Page structure (header → footer)
Global header (sticky)

Logo (link to /), primary nav (Services, Areas, Pricing, FAQs, Contact).

“Get a Quote” button + phone tap-to-call (tel:) prominent.

Optional super-bar: “Serving Ipswich • Brisbane • Logan · Open today” (auto switches to suburb on spokes).

Why: instant navigation + conversion affordance on every scroll.

Breadcrumbs

Home › Services › Bathroom Deep Clean (or … › Bathroom Deep Clean › Springfield)

Why: orientation for users + internal links for crawlers.

Hero

H1: Bathroom Deep Clean

Spoke version: Bathroom Deep Clean – <Suburb>

Subhead: one-sentence promise, e.g. “Deep sanitisation for tiles, grout, shower screens and fixtures—streak-free and mould-targeted.”

Primary CTA: Get a Fast Quote; Secondary: Call now.

Trust icons row (rating stars, “Agent-ready”, insurance/ABN).

Optional micro USP list (3 ticks): “Fixed price · Supplies included · Re-clean guarantee”.

Why: set the value prop, capture intent early.

Pain → Promise (Problem/Solution)

Short paragraph + 3–5 bullets:

Problems: soap scum haze, pink mould in grout, hard-water scale on glass, exhaust grime.

Promise: “We strip buildup, treat mould, polish glass/chrome, and leave a dry, streak-free finish.”

Why: show you “get it”, then show the outcome.

What’s Included (Acceptance Slice)

Pull from src/content/acceptance.bathroom-deep-clean.json.

Group by area: Shower | Bath | Vanity & Basin | Toilet | Floors & Skirting | Vents & Fittings.

Show check-tick list; include 1–2 scope clarifiers (e.g., “Non-structural mould treatment up to X m²”; “Standard ceiling height”).

Why: clarity reduces back-and-forth, boosts trust.

Before/After evidence

3–6 pairs (glass, grout lines, chrome tapware).

Add a single-image slider for at least one pair.

Caption with specifics: “Shower glass – heavy mineral scale removed; finish polished.”

Why: proof beats promises.

Add-ons / Upgrades (Card grid)

Examples:

Grout steam-revive (per bathroom)

Silicone mould remediation (non-replacement)

Calcium/scale intensive treatment (glass/tiles)

Exhaust fan deep-degunk

Vanity drawer cleanout/organise

Each card: name, what it fixes, “from $X” (or “quote on inspection”), add-to-quote button.

Why: raises AOV without bloating the core bundle.

Pricing & Inclusions clarifier

If you don’t show prices: “From $X for small ensuites · Transparent fixed quote after photos.”

Table (optional): Ensuite | Main bathroom | Plus separate toilet.

Note factors: heavy scale/mould, oversized areas, specialty stone care.

Why: set expectations; keep leads qualified.

How it works (3 steps)

Send quick photos (or select rooms)

We confirm price & time window

Deep clean & sign-off

Add time estimates (e.g., “Typical main bathroom 1.5–2.5 hrs”).

Why: reduces friction + shows professionalism.

Our processes & products (Safety/quality)

Bullet the methods: safe acid descaler on glass where needed, alkaline degrease for soap scum, neutralise & rinse, microfibre polish, mould-targeted biocide (non-chlorine option available), steam for grout (if chosen).

Safety notes: pet-safe protocols, ventilation, PPE.

Why: competence + reassurance.

Guarantees & standards

“Agent-ready finish” or “48-hour touch-up guarantee” (define conditions).

“Surfaces protected: we test, mask, and avoid acid-sensitive stone.”

Why: risk-reversal.

FAQ block (schema-eligible)

“Do you replace silicone or regrout?” (No—clean/remediate only; replacement available via referral.)

“Can you remove etched glass?” (No—etching is damage; we remove mineral scale and polish what’s left.)

“How do you handle heavy black mould?” (Scope limits + treatment process.)

“What should I do before you arrive?” (Clear personal items, unlock, water/power available, pets safe.)

Why: cut pre-booking emails; wins snippet potential.

Local service area (internal linking)

Hub version: link to top suburb spokes (e.g., Springfield, Redbank Plains, Goodna…).

Spoke version: link up to the service hub and across to 2 sibling suburbs; also link to Bond Cleaning and Spring Cleaning pages.

Why: topical authority + crawlable mesh.

Testimonials (Bathroom-specific if possible)

2–4 short quotes with rating stars; mention outcomes (glass clarity, grout brightening).

Why: social proof near decision point.

CTA band (repeat)

“Ready for a hotel-clean bathroom?” Get Quote / Call.

Include small print: availability windows, same-week slots.

Why: capture at the bottom too.

Footer

Mini sitemap: Services, Areas, Resources/Blog, Contact, Terms/Privacy.

Service area micro-links (noindex if duplicated elsewhere).

Contact details, ABN, working hours, socials.

Why: close out with trust + crawl paths.

Cross-service: within hero or CTA, link to Bond Cleaning (common upsell before exit cleans) and Spring Cleaning.

UX notes
Keep a sticky bottom CTA on mobile: “Get a Quote” + phone icon.

Use section IDs (#inclusions, #pricing, #faqs) so CTAs can jump-link.

Image ALT text: outcome-oriented (“Shower glass after mineral scale removal”).

Keep copy scannable: 4–6 line paragraphs max, bullets for detail.

If you want, I can turn this into an Astro page scaffold with Tailwind classes and slot in your existing AcceptanceSlice + Schema components—say a /services/bathroom-deep-clean/index.astro (hub) and a spoke template that accepts a <suburb> prop.
