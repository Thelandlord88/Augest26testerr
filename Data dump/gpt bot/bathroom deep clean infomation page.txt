You’ve handed me a solid page skeleton. I’m ready to turn it into conversion-ready, agent-aligned copy for a Bathroom Deep Clean service that works as a hub (multi-area) and scales to suburb spokes. I’ll keep the tone warm AU-English, wire in cluster-aware internal links, and layer in real-world process chemistry with clear safety and guarantees.

Action Plan

Confirm page type and targeting (5 minutes)
Choose: Hub (Ipswich • Brisbane • Logan) now; spokes later.
Assets checklist: 3–6 before/after pairs (glass, grout, chrome), rating badge, ABN/insurance icon, phone number for tel: link. Pass–fail: Hub H1 must include areas; CTAs visible on mobile and desktop.
2. Build the hero and top-of-page conversion block (10 minutes)

H1 + subhead that mirrors intent.
Primary CTA: Get a Fast Quote (links to /#quote), secondary CTA: Call Now (tel:).
Trust row: ratings, “Agent-ready”, insured/ABN. Pass–fail: Scroll test—CTA present above the fold on mobile; phone link tappable.
3. Draft Pain → Promise and What’s Included (15 minutes)

3–5 pains, then outcome-led promise.
Acceptance slice grouped by Shower, Bath, Vanity & Basin, Toilet, Floors & Skirting, Vents & Fittings.
Scope clarifiers: non-structural mould up to 2 m²; standard ceiling height up to 2.7 m. Pass–fail: No ambiguity on mould scope; glass etching limitation stated.
4. Add-ons/Upgrades, Pricing clarifier, How it works (10 minutes)

4–6 upgrade cards with “from $X” or “quote on inspection”.
Pricing notes: size/condition factors; time estimate (typical main bathroom 1.5–2.5 hrs). Pass–fail: Clear sliders on scope; no surprise-add perception.
5. Process SOP with ratios and dwell times + Safety box (15 minutes)

Chemically accurate, agent-safe workflow: alkaline → acid → neutralise → rinse → polish → mould treatment (non-chlorine option).
Safety: PPE, ventilation, spot-tests; never mix bleach with ammonia or acids (chlorine gas risk); protect acid-sensitive stone. Pass–fail: No hazardous mixes; AU guardrails explicit; dilution/dwell ranges included.
6. Guarantees, FAQs, Local linking mesh (10 minutes)

48-hour touch-up guarantee (conditions).
FAQ schema-eligible questions that deflect common tickets.
Internal links: hub → spokes; cross-service upsells; cluster-aware blog links. Pass–fail: At least 2–3 internal links live; guarantees framed as policy, not certainty.
7. Technical SEO and JSON (10 minutes)

Meta title/description within limits; section IDs for jump links.
Acceptance JSON; Service + FAQPage JSON-LD. Pass–fail: Title ≤60 chars; Description ≤155; JSON validates.
Why It Works
This blends buyer psychology (proof, clarity, risk-reversal) with operations reality (ratios, dwell times, scope limits), so expectations are set and met. The internal link mesh builds topical authority while the safety/SOP earns trust with both clients and property managers.

Our Process & Products (SOP + Safety)
Method overview

Soap scum removal (alkaline): Apply an alkaline degreaser 1:10–1:20 with water (pH ~10–12). Dwell 5–7 minutes. Agitate with non-scratch pads. Rinse thoroughly.
Descale glass/ceramic (acid): Apply a safe acid descaler (e.g., citric 5–10% or phosphoric 10–15%). Dwell 3–5 minutes. Do not let dry. Light agitation if needed. Rinse to neutral. Avoid acid on marble/terrazzo/travertine—use non-acid method there.
Neutralise & polish: Follow with a neutral pH rinse, then microfibre polish on glass, chrome and mirror surfaces for a streak-free finish.
Mould treatment (non-chlorine option): Apply a quaternary ammonium compound-based biocide at 0.2–0.5% to non-porous surfaces. Dwell 10 minutes. Rinse or wipe to finish. For stubborn spots, oxygen-based gel (3–6% hydrogen-peroxide class) may be used—colourfast test first.
Grout steam (if chosen): Controlled passes with 140–160°C steam, towels to capture condensate; keep nozzle moving to protect grout.
Safety (AU guardrails)

PPE: gloves, eye protection, mask as required; keep the room well ventilated.
Never mix bleach with ammonia or acids—risk of toxic chlorine gas.
Spot-test on a small, inconspicuous area; protect acid-sensitive stone and plated finishes.
Floors may be slippery when wet; keep kids and pets out until dry.
Guarantees & standards

48-hour touch-up guarantee: If you’re not happy with a listed inclusion, we return to address it within 2 business days. Excludes reappearance of mould from ongoing moisture/ventilation issues or silicone/structural defects.
Agent-ready finish when booked as part of exit/bond cleaning; we align to common agent checklists and note that outcome depends on property condition, access and scope.
FAQs (schema-ready)

Do you replace silicone or regrout? We clean and remediate surface mould only; silicone replacement or regrouting is via referral or pre-quoted trade.
Can you remove etched/burnt glass? Etching is permanent surface damage. We remove mineral scale and polish the remaining surface; improvement, not full restoration.
How do you handle heavy black mould? We treat non-structural mould on non-porous surfaces within scope. For porous substrate or recurring moisture problems, we’ll flag remediation or ventilation fixes.
What should I do before you arrive? Clear personal items, unlock the area, ensure water/power access, and secure pets. Run the exhaust or open a window if possible.
Are your products pet-safe? Yes—we select low-residue options and rinse surfaces. Let us know if you prefer non-chlorine products only.

Mobile UX notes

Keep a sticky bottom bar on mobile: “Get a Quote” + phone icon.
Use section IDs like #inclusions, #pricing, #faqs so CTAs can jump-link.
Use outcome-oriented ALT text (e.g., “Grout after steam reviving”).

If you’re happy, I’ll finalise: 1 hub page + 3 spokes (Springfield Lakes, Indooroopilly, Logan Central), and tailor the copy where needed.
If you have preferred image sets, suburb priorities, or “from $” price anchors, drop them in and I’ll bake them in before handover.
