Preview of suburbs_enriched_simple.csv


Done! I ‚Äúdumbed down‚Äù each file into a lean, easy-to-use version (kept only the most useful fields, normalized headers, dropped duplicates; for GeoJSON I trimmed properties, dropped Z values, and rounded coordinates to shrink size).

Here are your downloads:

suburbs_simple.csv

suburbs_enriched_simple.csv

suburbs_simple.geojson

suburbs_enriched_simple.geojson

I also popped open a quick summary table and previews so you can eyeball what changed. If you want the GeoJSON simplified even further (e.g., stronger coordinate rounding or full topology simplification), or different columns kept/renamed, tell me the rules and I‚Äôll regenerate.

sorry. No...i ment just dumb down an explaination of what these files are

Thought for 24s
ah gotcha ‚Äî my bad! here‚Äôs the plain-English version üëá

What each file is

suburbs.csv
A simple spreadsheet: one row per suburb with basic details (e.g., name, state/LGA, postcode, maybe a rough lat/lon).

suburbs_enriched.csv
Same spreadsheet but with extra columns (‚Äúenriched‚Äù = more detail/metrics). Think: the basics plus additional numbers/labels your project cares about.

suburbs.geojson
A map file: it contains the actual suburb shapes/boundaries. There are 345 suburb features in it. Each feature has a polygon (the shape) and some basic info (name, state, postcode) attached.

suburbs_enriched.geojson
Same suburb shapes as above, but the attached info (the ‚Äúproperties‚Äù) is beefed up with extra fields ‚Äî i.e., the map version of the enriched table.

Mental model

CSVs = tables you‚Äôd open in Excel/Sheets.

GeoJSONs = map layers you‚Äôd open in GIS tools (QGIS) or on the web (Leaflet/Mapbox).

How they‚Äôre used together

Use the CSV for lists, sorting, and charts.

Use the GeoJSON when you need to draw the suburbs on a map.

If you want a thematic map (e.g., color suburbs by some score), use the enriched versions or join the plain CSV to the plain GeoJSON by a common field (like suburb name or postcode).

If you want, I can point out the exact key columns to join on, or sketch a tiny example.

totally‚Äîhere are great free places to open, edit, style, or share GeoJSON online:

Quick view / edit (drag-and-drop)

geojson.io ‚Äì dead-simple viewer/editor; draw, edit properties, export. 
geojson.io

Mapshaper ‚Äì view, simplify, fix/clean geometry, and convert (GeoJSON ‚áÑ TopoJSON/Shapefile). 
mapshaper.org

Big, pretty visualizations in the browser

kepler.gl (web app) ‚Äì upload GeoJSON (or load by URL), make layered & animated maps. Data stays in your browser (docs note ~250 MB browser limit). 
docs.kepler.gl

Share a link to an interactive map

GitHub ‚Äì just push a .geojson; GitHub auto-renders it as an interactive map you can share. 
GitHub Docs
The GitHub Blog

Felt ‚Äì online map builder with a free plan; supports uploading GeoJSON (including by URL) and large files (docs mention up to 5 GB). 
Felt
help.felt.com
developers.felt.com

Datawrapper ‚Äì make choropleth/locator maps; you can upload custom GeoJSON/TopoJSON for the basemap or add lines/areas. Easy to embed/share.

Note on Google tools

Google My Maps doesn‚Äôt directly accept GeoJSON. It supports CSV/TSV/XLSX, KML/KMZ, GPX (or WKT inside CSV). Convert your GeoJSON first (Mapshaper can do it). 
Google Help

If you‚Äôre comfortable coding, the Google Maps JavaScript API can load GeoJSON into a custom webpage.
