Absolutely—if you’re stepping up to a paid Netlify plan, here’s what’s worth implementing for your Astro site (high-ROI first), plus exactly how each piece fits your stack.

What to turn on (and why)
1) Netlify Analytics (server-side)

Zero JS, no CLS/CPU hit; you still keep GA4 for events only.

Use it to watch pageviews, top pages, referrers and 404s without adding scripts. 
CSS-Tricks
Netlify Docs

Do: Enable Project Analytics on the site; add a GA4 Measurement Protocol function for quote events later.

2) Image CDN (/.netlify/images)

Automatic AVIF/WebP, width/quality transforms at the edge; perfect for your SmartImage helper and Markdown/remote images. 
Netlify Docs

Do: Route public/remote assets through /.netlify/images?url=…&w=…&fm=…; keep astro:assets for local imports.

3) Edge Functions

Geo-aware nudges (detect QLD locality), canonicalization (defensive redirects), A/B experiments, header/cookie work—all without shipping JS. Runs on Deno at the CDN edge. 
Netlify Docs

Do: Small edge middleware to (a) 301 any non-canonical blog/service paths, (b) attach geo hints for preselecting clusters.

4) Scheduled & Background Functions

Nightly chores (ping sitemap, pre-warm images, regenerate JSON data), and longer runs (email digests, image batch work) without blocking requests. 
Netlify Docs
GitHub

Do: Cron a sitemap-ping and a prewarm-images job; move any long tasks (e.g., generating thumbnails) to background functions.

5) On-demand Builders (Distributed Persistent Rendering)

Generate long-tail suburb pages on first hit and cache them—great if you expand beyond your current whitelist without making builds slow. 
Netlify Docs

Do: Keep today’s core suburbs prebuilt; wire low-traffic fringe suburbs as ODB endpoints.

6) Password-protect non-prod + Branch/Deploy Previews

Gate previews behind a password; share safe links with agents/clients; keep crawlers out. 
Netlify Support Forums

Do: Add basic auth for previews; keep your “preview = noindex” headers as you already do.

7) Firewall Rules (Business+)

Rate-limit bots, block abusive IPs/countries, and shield quotes endpoint. 
Netlify Docs

Do: Add a low-risk rule set: throttle /quote submissions and deny obvious scrapers.

8) Forms (progressive-enhancement fallback)

If the JS quote form fails, Netlify can still capture fields server-side and notify you; you can also route submissions to functions/webhooks. 
Netlify Support Forums

Do: Add netlify/netlify-honeypot attributes to the form as a resilient fallback.

9) Blobs + Function Metrics

Blobs: simple, serverless storage for leads or “abandoned quote” drafts. Function Metrics: see errors/duration per function and correlate to deploys.

Do: Store quote drafts in Blobs; watch Function Metrics to catch slowdowns.

10) Split Testing with branch deploys (optional)

Flip hero copy/layout variants at the edge and keep it sticky with cookies—no client JS.

Performance & UX

Turn on Image CDN and route non-import images via /.netlify/images. (Keep <Image> for local imports.) 
Netlify Docs

Add a scheduled function to pre-request your heaviest images and checklist pages weekly (primes the CDN). 
Netlify Docs

SEO & Routing

Edge Function: enforce lowercase/slugged service/blog paths and add a fast 301 for any legacy cluster in the URL. 
Netlify Docs

Scheduled function: ping Search Console/Bing with /sitemap.xml on every successful production deploy. 
Netlify Docs

Analytics without bloat

Enable Netlify Analytics (server logs, no JS). Keep GA4 only for quote events via a tiny serverless function.

Security & Ops

Add password protection for Deploy Previews. 
Netlify Support Forums

On Business, add Firewall rules: rate-limit /api/quote and block known bad ASNs. 
Netlify Docs

Start using Function Metrics to watch your quote function’s success rate and p95 duration.

Scale without slower builds

Migrate any “maybe later” suburb pages to On-demand Builders; prebuild only the top 50 suburbs; let the rest generate on first view. 
Netlify Docs

Tiny code stubs (drop-ins)
Edge redirect (canonical service URL)

ts
Copy
Edit
// netlify/edge-functions/canonicalize.ts
export default async (req: Request) => {
  const url = new URL(req.url);
  url.pathname = url.pathname.replace(/\/services\/([^/]+)\/[^/]+\/([^/]+)/, '/services/$1/$2'); // drop cluster
  if (url.pathname !== new URL(req.url).pathname) return Response.redirect(url.toString(), 301);
  return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
};
export const config = { path: "/*" };
(Attach in Netlify config; complements your existing Netlify redirects.) 
Netlify Docs

Scheduled sitemap ping

js
Copy
Edit
// netlify/functions/ping-sitemaps.ts
export default async () => {
  const base = 'https://onendonebondclean.com.au';
  await Promise.all([
    fetch(`https://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=${base}/sitemap.xml`),
    fetch(`https://www.bing.com/ping?sitemap=${base}/sitemap.xml`)
  ]);
  return new Response("ok");
};
// netlify.toml -> [functions] and [[scheduled.functions]] cron = "0 2 * * 1"
Netlify Docs

On-demand builder for a fringe suburb

js
Copy
Edit
// netlify/functions/suburb-page.js
import { builder } from "@netlify/functions";
export const handler = builder(async (event) => {
  // generate HTML using your templates & JSON data
  const html = renderSuburb(event.queryStringParameters.slug);
  return { statusCode: 200, headers: { "content-type": "text/html" }, body: html };
});

Plan by tier
Pro: Analytics, Image CDN, Edge/Functions, Scheduled/Background Functions, Deploy Previews (password), Split testing. Good default for you. 
Netlify Support Forums

Business: Everything in Pro + Firewall rules, SSO/SAML, SLAs, log drains—choose if you want traffic rules and enterprise controls. 
Netlify Docs

What changes you’ll feel immediately
Faster loads from image transforms at the edge; fewer layout shifts (no GA tag for pageviews).

Safer ops with passworded previews, basic firewall rate-limits, and function observability.

If you want, I can draft the Netlify config (edge function registration, scheduled jobs block, analytics toggle checklist) and the SmartImage helper wired to /.netlify/images so you can paste it in and ship.
